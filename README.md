  #### Strategy
    This project is made for horselovers, mainly horse buyers but also just them who have an interest. 
    Goals is to sell horses and get customer for upcoming breeding season.
    Want to advertice the breed and tell about the Team Kigers company.
  
  #### Scope
    Gallery, pictures opens in new site when clicked. Scroll-site but also a menu to get to the different sections.
    Social media buttons
  
  #### Structure
    History and facts go together, about the owner and a great picture, for sale and how to buy go together, socail media and other         cooperationlinks goes together.
    Grid is used the same on about, history and also for sale.
    
  #### Sceleton
    Great attractive looking pictures are shown in parallax effect on desktop, on smaller devices its just a fixed background that you       scroll.
